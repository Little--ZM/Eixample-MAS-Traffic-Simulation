They (try to) avoid collisions.\r\n\r\nTODO: Implement Distributed AI and add other functionalities to car agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensed under GNU GPL v3\r\n\r\nEixample is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation version 3.\r\n\r\nEixample is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
